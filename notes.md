* JS for FE and BE
* JS is not a language for FE anymore
* React JS is FE
* Angular, Vue.js, Ember.js

* Performance
* DOM -> Document Object Model

* the memory used is significantly large
* As the DOM tree grows, the time taken to make changes also goes up

* React JS provides us with a Virtual DOM
* You use React API and not the direct DOM API

* Component-based approach for working with FE
* ES6

* Single Page Applications
